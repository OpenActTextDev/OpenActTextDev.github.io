# Open Actuarial Textbooks Project: Development Site

This site is for teachers, authors, and others who seek to contribute to the development of free and open actuarial textbooks.

## Project Goal

The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. If this is your first visit to this site, you may wish to get additional background information about the project and its relationship to open education. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about the project.

# Loss Data Analytics - Edition One

The first edition of *Loss Data Analytics*, an interactive, online, freely available text, was completed in 2018.

* The [online version](https://OpenActTextDev.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) contains many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
* A subset of the book is available for [offline reading](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/DownloadOffline.html) in pdf and EPUB formats.
* The online text has been translated into Spanish to promote access to a worldwide audience.

The [Open Actuarial Textbooks Landing Page](https://openacttexts.github.io/) provides access to resources supporting the first edition.

Prospective contributors should also check out our [Style Guide](https://ewfrees.github.io/StyleGuideLDA/index.html) 

We are also experimenting with a [WordPress site](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jfrees/loss-data-analytics/).

# R Codes for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. To get an idea of what the files will generate for users, see the [Online Version from R Code Support](https://ewfrees.github.io/LDARcode/index.html).

Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/LDARCode).

# Interactive Features of Loss Data Analytics

[This repository](https://OpenActTextDevwfrees.github.io/InteractiveLDA/index.html) describes the interactive features being developed for *Loss Data Analytics*.

# Overheads for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides chapter summaries in the form of overheads to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. Overheads in .pdf format and source code is available at a development [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsOverheads).

# Translation Demonstration

*  Several chapters have been [translated into Spanish](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics-Spanish/) and more are forthcoming.
* Here is a [version of the book](https://alyaanuval.github.io/LDATranslate/C-Intro.html#S:Intro) where we translated a section from English to Malay. 
* The instructions for doing the translation are at a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alyaanuval/LDATranslate). 

# Life Contingencies / Actuarial Mathematics

The initial focus of the project is on *Loss Data Analytics* although we hope to expand to other actuarial texts. In that spirit, we organize several sets of notes for *Life Contingencies*, also known as *Actuarial Mathematics* and *Long Term Actuarial Mathematics*. See the development [GitHub Site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LifeCon).
