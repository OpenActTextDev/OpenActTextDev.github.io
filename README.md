### Open Actuarial Textbooks Project: Development Site

This site is for teachers, authors, and others who seek to contribute to the development of free and open actuarial textbooks.

## Project Goal

The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. If this is your first visit to this site, you may wish to get additional background information about the project and its relationship to open education. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about the project.

## Loss Data Analytics - Edition One

The first edition of *Loss Data Analytics*, an interactive, online, freely available text, was completed in 2018.

* The [online version](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) contains many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
* A subset of the book is available for [offline reading](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics-Ed1/DownloadOffline.html) in pdf and EPUB formats.
* The online text has been [translated into Spanish](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/LDASpanish/) to promote access to a worldwide audience.

The [Open Actuarial Textbooks Landing Page](https://OpenActTexts.github.io/) provides access to resources supporting the first edition.

# Development Site

We are currently working on three projects to support open actuarial education: (1) a short course featuring **R** code tutorials to support *Loss Data Analytics*, (2) a second edition of *Loss Data Analytics*, and (3) a new book on life contingent mathematics.

Visit the [Short Course](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDACourse1/); you can see how it came about at our [Short Course Development Strategy](https://openacttextdev.github.io/LDAShortCourseStrategy/index.html).

## Loss Data Analytics - Edition Two

Work has begun in 2022 to develop a second edition of *Loss Data Analytics* (LDA). 

*  A **Steering Committee** has assembled a set of [Guiding Principles](https://openacttextdev.github.io/LDA_Ed2_Strategy/) to be used to direct the development of the second edition.
*  Prospective contributors should start with our [Style Guide](https://ewfrees.github.io/StyleGuideLDA/index.html) 
*  [This repository][(https://OpenActTextDev.github.io/InteractiveLDA/index.html](https://openacttextdev.github.io/InteractiveFeatures/)) describes the interactive features being contemplated for *Loss Data Analytics*.
*  The most recent version of the book is available at [online version](https://OpenActTextDev.github.io/LDA_Ed2/index.html) in *.html* format.
*  The source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/LDA_Ed2).  

## Life Contingencies

The initial focus of the project is on *Loss Data Analytics* although we hope to expand to other actuarial texts. In that spirit, a small group has started work on another core discipline within actuarial science. The tentative title is [Life Contingencies: The Mathematics, Statistics, and Economics of Life Insurance](https://openacttextdev.github.io/LifeCon/).  See the development [GitHub Site](https://github.com/openacttextdev/LifeCon).

# Other Efforts 

### R Codes for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. To get an idea of what the files will generate for users, see the [Online Version from R Code Support](https://ewfrees.github.io/LDARcode/index.html).

Source code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/LDARCode).

### Overheads for Loss Data Analytics

This site provides chapter summaries in the form of overheads to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. Overheads in .pdf format and source code is available at a development [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsOverheads).

### Translation Demonstration

*  Several chapters have been [translated into Spanish](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics-Spanish/) and more are forthcoming.
* Here is a [version of the book](https://alyaanuval.github.io/LDATranslate/C-Intro.html#S:Intro) where we translated a section from English to Malay. 
* The instructions for doing the translation are at a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alyaanuval/LDATranslate). 

We are also experimenting with a [WordPress site](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jfrees/loss-data-analytics/).
